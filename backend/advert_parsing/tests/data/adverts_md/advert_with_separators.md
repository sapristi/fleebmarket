Hello,
after moving on to smaller form factors, I'd like to sell my Kiria. I have also some leftover blank DCS caps.

Note that the Kyria PCB has been **moded** (read, holes were drilled, and external wiring added) to accept 2u choc keypaps on thumbs.

 Asking 180€ for the Kyria:

   - Red Kailh choc switches
   - Black acrylic case (low profile)
   - Puck and Manfrotto Tripods
   - underglow
   - 2 pro-micro (usb-c, reinforced with epoxy)
   - Rev1, moded to accept 2u choc keycaps on thumbs
   - included for free if you want them:
     - white kailh choc keycaps (as seen in pictures)
     - some extra switches (red and brown kailh choc)
     - TRRS cable

I'm also selling blank DCS R3 (Unalice keyset): for 1€ each; https://i.imgur.com/ruzvcyt.jpeg  (2x1.25u, 2x1.5u, 1x2u for each color)
