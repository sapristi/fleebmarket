Good afternoon /r/mechmarket 

Things for sale today:

**Dinghy 40%**

Minivan/Jetvan Layout Ketch PCB in a large bezel Dinghy 3DP case.  Built with Lubed and Filmed Silent Alpacas, and Lubed Durock Stabilizer on an Acrylic Plate.  Super quiet, very pleasing flexible typing experience.  Overall a really nice board that I just don't have room for anymore.  I'm also including a 2nd 3DP case in Marble colorway at no additional cost.  

Asking $125 Shipped CONUS

**Artisans**

Getting out of the artisan scene for a while as I'm just burnt out.  The 3 Sets of colorways are negotiable on pricing within reason, but I'm pretty close to what I'm looking to get out of them.  I'm losing money on almost all of these anyway.  Posting the chart below in case my picture is hard to read.
