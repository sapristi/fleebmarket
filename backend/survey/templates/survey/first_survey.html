              <p>This is the pre-launch survey for fleebmarket. Fleebmarket is a would-be keyboard and keyboard parts second hand market.</p>

              <p>I am running this survey in order to have a little more insight into the subject, and have some more guidance on what might be most desired features. I will launch Fleebmarket whatever the results, and, depending on the traction it gets, will keep on with the development of new features or not.</p>

              <p>I do intend to make some money off of it eventually, but I am mostly interested in providing a nice experience and designing the right tool for the job. </p>

              <p>You can read more about the Fleebarket project in the <a href="{% url "about" %}">about page</a>.</p>
